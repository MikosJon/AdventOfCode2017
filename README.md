# Advent of Code 2017
Solutions for [advent of code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017). All of the solutions will be written in python3. I might solve them in C++ as well just to learn the language a bit better since I've just started learning it.

Most of the programs can be run with
```bash
python3 partx.py
```
or in some cases
```bash
python3 partx.py < input.txt
```
I've written how to run each file in a comment at the top of said file. And don't forget to replace the input with your input, since everybody gets a different one.
